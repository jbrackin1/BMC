				<h2>Understanding Your Report</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Homocysteine:</strong> Keep levels below 10 μmol/L. Lower is
						often better. High levels can indicate inflammation and cognitive
						risk.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Vitamin B12:</strong> Target: 500–1500 pg/mL. Needed for
						memory, cognition, and energy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>CRP (Inflammation):</strong> Goal: Below 0.9 mg/dL. Use
						diet, sleep, and omega-3s to reduce.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>ApoB:</strong> Goal: Below 100 mg/dL. A more specific
						predictor of heart and brain risk than LDL.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Wellness & Prevention Tips</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						✅ Eat anti-inflammatory foods like leafy greens, berries, olive
						oil, and fatty fish
					</li>

					</li>
					<li>✅ Consider vitamin D and B-complex if levels are low</li>

						plasticity
