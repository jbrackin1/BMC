			<h1>About BetterMindCare</h1>

			<p>
				BetterMindCare was created with one purpose: to support families and
				caregivers navigating Alzheimer’s and cognitive decline with compassion,
				clarity, and personalized insight.
			</p>

			<h2>Why We Exist</h2>
			<p>
				Too many people feel alone in the journey of memory loss. From confusing
				lab results to inconsistent advice, it’s easy to feel lost.
				BetterMindCare bridges that gap by offering personalized reports,
				preventive insights, and actionable next steps—all grounded in
				evidence-based care.
			</p>

			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>✔️ We guide users through a structured intake process</li>
				<li>
					✔️ We collect key health data via forms, optional labs, and screening
					tests
				</li>
				<li>
					✔️ We apply research-backed recommendation logic to build a custom
					Patient Report
				</li>
				<li>
					✔️ We provide insight, not overwhelm—with visual charts, simple
					explanations, and next steps
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
			<p>
				We combine scientific rigor with spiritual and emotional sensitivity.
				Our platform is HIPAA-compliant, user-friendly, and designed for
				caregivers—not clinicians. Whether you’re just starting to ask questions
				or deep in the caregiving trenches, we meet you where you are.
			</p>

			<h2>Our Commitment</h2>
			<p>
				We believe better care begins with better understanding. That’s why
				every Patient Report we create is more than data—it’s a step toward
				peace of mind, dignity, and clarity.
